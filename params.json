{"body":"# distuli is a jQuery plugin\r\n* This plugin uses jQuery deferreds to do things after CSS animations and/or transitions are complete.\r\n\r\n# distuli?\r\n* Google translate provided distuli as the Latin translation of deferred.\r\n* The word is uncommon and thus should be safe in your $.fn namespace.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n<pre>\r\n$(\"#thingy\").distuli({\r\n  name: \"name\", // the name of a css selector with a transition or animation\r\n  complete: function() {\r\n    //do stuff\r\n    $(this).html(\"I got animated.\"); // the element with an id of \"thingy\" now has \"I got animated.\" in it.\r\n  }\r\n});\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n## Details\r\n* **name** is a CSS selector name.\r\n* **complete** is a function that fires when the transition or animation finishes.\r\n* You may use $(this) in the function to do stuff to the element that was animated.\r\n* The plugin does not remove the selector name from the element upon completion (so the programmer can decide when it's best to do so).\r\n\r\n## Roadmap\r\n* My plans include support for listing multiple selector names and tracking/reporting completion of each step.\r\n\r\n## About the Author\r\n* [Dan Kapusta](http://about.me/dankapusta) is a UI Engineer at AOL and is trying to keep things simple.\r\n* I wrote this to learn more about css animations and jQuery deferreds.\r\n* This is my first plugin, so it's far from perfect.\r\n\r\n## Inspiration and Acknowledgments\r\n* I thought to write this after seeing [Dan Eden's animate.css](http://daneden.me/animate/)\r\n* The plugin Boilerplate is from [Addy Osmani's](http://addyosmani.com) [Essential jQuery Plugin Patterns](http://coding.smashingmagazine.com/2011/10/11/essential-jquery-plugin-patterns/) article.\r\n* The transition/animation name pattern was adapted from code by [Mark MacKay](http://duopixel.ca/).\r\n* Many thanks to [the entire jQuery development team](http://jquery.org/team/).\r\n\r\n## Copyright and License\r\n* Copyright (c) 2011 Daniel Kapusta\r\n* Licensed under the [MIT License](http://www.opensource.org/licenses/mit-license.php)\r\n","tagline":"distuli is a jQuery plugin that uses jQuery deferreds to do things after CSS animations and/or transitions are complete","google":"UA-16063192-6","note":"Don't delete this file!
